Why is it called fruitbat?
--------------------------
A lot of time was spent trying to figure out a 'nice' acronym, however none of the
potential names seemed to fit. So I decided to just name it after an animal. 
After searching through lists of Australian animals I remembered the family of
fruitbats (grey-headed flying foxes) that live in the tree in the front of my house.
Fruitbat had the letters FRB in order and their orange necks reminded me of waterfall
plots so I decided to so with Fruitbat as the name.
